# Train_Scheduler

Train Scheduler is a scheduling tool for fictitious trains. It is made with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, Firebase, and Moment JS. The theme is lego because I do love my lego train set. 

There is a section to view the trains currently running and a place for a user to add more trains to the schedule. 

There currently is still some bugs with the Firebase database and positioning that will be fixed soon.
